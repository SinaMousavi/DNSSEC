    "The paper introduces several concepts and methodologies that can be implemented as code to enhance DNSSEC key management and analysis. I chose two of the concepts that were mentioned in the paper for a simple implementation, which are **Behavior-Based Classification Tool** and **Continuous DNSKEY Lifetime Analysis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "First one is **Behavior-Based Classification Tool**. It is a tool that classifies DNSSEC key transitions based on behavior rather than strict adherence to RFC guidelines. This tool would analyze DNS key data to categorize transitions into types such as **“Multi-Signatures,” “Co-Present,” “Cutovers,” etc.**\n",
    "Here are steps in this process:\n",
    "- Parse DNS zone files or DNSSEC key data to extract key transitions.\n",
    "- Apply rules for classifying transitions based on observed overlaps and usage patterns.\n",
    "- Output classified transitions for further analysis."
